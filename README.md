I have Created a complete backend Banking Application in golang backed by elasticsearch

## Features:
1. JWT based Authentication
2. BCRYPT based Password Encryption
3. Loosely Coupled Code
4. Code Structure is Same as Spring boot's

## Steps to Clone:
1. Download Zip file/ Clone it to your system
2. Extract the zip files and copy all the internal files and folders to a new Folder: github.com/Poojan-patel/Banking-App-Golang-ElasticSearch. 
3. Download ElasticSearch from web.
4. Use chrome Extenstion ElasticVue, for fantastic GUI. https://elasticvue.com/
5. Download postman or any API Tester

## Steps to Run the code
1. After Setting all the things, open Postman. import "postman_collection.json" file.
2. This will import all the API points exposed by Server
3. go to vscode, and run the code by applying these two command below
